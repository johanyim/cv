## Experience
### Software Developer - *BG Automotive*
> `2024-05` - `Present`
- Implemented stateless, secure authentication using `JWT`s stored in HTTP-only cookies, with access and refresh token rotation for session management.
- Implemented HTTP middleware in `Rust` using `Redis` as an intermediary cache layer, Server-Sent Events, and frontend Virtualization/Windowing to handle payloads 600 times larger.
- Developed a silent background process that monitors key presses and recognizes barcode syntax, triggering image capture from the warehouse CCTV system.
- Applied systems programming concepts, including mutex-based synchronization, to prevent race conditions and manage concurrent write operations.
- Used `cron`, the GNU coreutils, and `git` to create an automated deployment pipeline for various automated services.
- Deployed 10 containerized cloud applications optimized for resource efficiency, achieving reliable operation on a single low-tier cloud instance.
### Volunteer Data Assistant - *Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution*
> `2024-03` - `2024-05`
- Used text-manipulation tools from the GNU coreutils such as `awk` and `sed` to process and clean existing tabular data.
- Interfaced with the `xlsxwriter` C library to programmatically generate non-trivial excel spreadsheets, such as spawning charts and extracting/including VBA macros.
## Projects
### Structure-Preserving Encryption and Decryption - *https://github.com/johanyim/spead*
- Improved developer experience by enforcing command-line flag validation to prevent misuse.
- Distributed CPU-bound parallel workloads to several threads to reduce the amount of time taken to encrypt and decrypt.
- Measured the performance using benchmarks using the criterion crate
- Implements a module for response caching, which can be used in a variety of related projects
