## Experience
### Software Developer - *BG Automotive*
> `2024-05` - `Present`
- Implemented stateless, secure authentication using `JWT`s stored in HTTP-only cookies, with access and refresh token rotation for session management.
- Implemented HTTP middleware using `Redis` as an intermediary cache layer, Server-Sent Events, and frontend Virtualization/Windowing to handle payloads 600 times larger, 400 times faster.
- Developed a silent background process that monitors key presses and recognizes barcode syntax, triggering image capture from the warehouse CCTV system.
- Applied systems programming concepts, including mutex-based synchronization, to prevent race conditions and manage concurrent write operations.
- Used `cron`, the GNU coreutils, and `git` to create an automated deployment pipeline for various automated services.
- Deployed 10 containerized cloud applications optimized for resource efficiency, achieving reliable operation on a single low-tier cloud instance.
### Volunteer Data Assistant - *Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution*
